# ADSA

## OBJECTIVE

Beeing able to send the two robots their position and the position of their ennemies in real time using cameras and wifi connections.

## ROADMAP

- [X] 1) Compile all the dependancies nedded for ARMv7 (OpenCV, Node.js, ...)
- [X] 2) Use a simple preset to benchmark the diffrent plafomrs (number of frame per seconds)
- [ ] 3) Experiment with video feeds and calibrate the camera (distortion matrix)
- [ ] 4) Learn to recognize et position in 3D, printed QRcodes with OpenCV and ArcUco
- [ ] 5) Deduce the position of all the robots
- [ ] 6) Implement some kind of syncronysation system so that slaves and master share the same time
- [ ] 7) Benchmark the diffrents implementations to see which one is preferable
- [ ] 8) Implement some kind of vizualtisation interface to see robots movments in real time (three.js ?)
- [ ] 9) Setup the live comunication with the robots
